# Sniper Execution, FAQ
So Probably many of you will see this Repository and don't know what is this, I'll tell you: Basically, Sniper Softworks, 
which is my team of Developers, is designing an exploit for Roblox called Sniper Execution, which has several features and
promises to Bypass Byfron Anti-Cheat, and will work on Roblox, remaining always Undetectable. If you want to suppport
this Project and Our Team, it will be very great! Thanks Again.

# Sniper Execution, Release Date & Sneak Peeks
We Don't Know when Sniper is Ready for its official Release, and also we don't really know if it will be free. The Developement
Started a few days ago and even if the Exploit is at a good point, the Website and the Team it self is not prepared for some things.
Probably, we will finish the project the next month but we are NOT SURE. In the Executor we'll include features like the UNC Supports,
Monaco Script Editor with Tabs, User-interface Customization, and other things.

# Sniper Execution, Exploit API & Anti-Cracking System
Many of you were probably asking this question, and yeah we have an answer to this: Sniper Execution API will be Private, obviously
Developed by Our Team, and promising to insert into the Exploit an Anti-Cracking System for Decompiling the Program and find several
important files. But How does this work? Basically in Our Discord server will sent a message by Our Own Security-Bot that the following
User has tried to Crack or Bypass our limit Systems. This may sound a little bit scary, but we promise you: For the first time, we'll
only do a warning and then, you can say goodbye to the Exploit! >:]
